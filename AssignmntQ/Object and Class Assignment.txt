 Class object Assignment
    
1) Create a class Box that uses a parameterized constructor to initialize the dimensions of a box.

The dimensions of the Box are width, height, depth.

The class should have a method that can return the volume of the box.

Create an object of the Box class and test the functionalities. 

2) Design a class that can be used by a health care professional to keep track of a patient’s vital statistics. 
 The following are the details.

Name of the class - Patient

Member Variables - patientName(String),height(double),weight(double)

Member Function - double computeBMI()

The above method should compute the BMI and return the result. The formula for computation of BMI  
is weight (in kg) ÷ height*height(in metres).

Create an object of the Patient class and check the results.
